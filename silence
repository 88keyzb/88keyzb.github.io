    <h1> Silence </h1>
    2/4/2022
<p>Most of modern life is not silent. There is talking with others, the noise of freeways and cars, the wind, and in many public places background music (or muzak).</p>
<p>I've noticed a trend of thought recently about the importance of solitude and silence. The constant buzz and stimulation of life takes away from moments of reflection and peace. There must be a balance. I enjoy these moments of silence, and try to intentionally build them into my life.</p>
<p>A wrench has recently been thrown into all of this, which is Covid, but not in the way you'd think. I tested positive for Covid, and in the quarantine, I noticed a ringing in my ears that up until that point never seemed to be significant.</p>
<p>To my surprise and shock, I am not the only one. There is a possible link between Covid and tinnitus. That Covid could cause my ears to ring for an extended period of time, even after multiple vaccines and a booster, is not something that was on my radar at all.</p>
<p>During quarantine, I have been attempting to read, but in the silence, the ringing keeps nagging me. But I don't notice it when I walk outside, or listen to music. From what I've found from sources online, this could be temporary or permanent. Obviously, I'm very frustrated.</p>
<p>Whatever comes of this, I think my relationship to silence will be profoundly different. If this is temporary, I will more than ever appreciate the peace that silence brings. If not, I will have to develop coping mechanisms (of which currently is to listen to sounds/music while reading) to deal with this. </p>
<p>Silence is a gift.</p>
