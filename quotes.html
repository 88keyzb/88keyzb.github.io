                  <p>People are memory palaces, too. They can be revisited like old neighborhoods, after long periods of
                     estrangement, calling up memories that were previously forgotten. There is no erasing your past self,
                     because
                     everything youâ€™ve ever been is sharded and stored among all the people, places, and artifacts youâ€™ve
                     interacted
                     with.

               <blockquote>
                  <p>Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the quality of
                     life
                     depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly successions; and that only
                     teachers
                     can
                     properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of
                     classified packages accessible only to those who carry the proper tags.

                  <p>A child can teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and
                     to
                     know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.

                  <p>This monopoly over land turns space into car fodder. It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles.
                     Even
                     if
                     planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting public services, their inhuman velocities would
                     degrade
                     man's innate mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.

                     harder. They fix the design.

                  <p>Theory: The dreads and dangers of abstract thinking are a big reason why we now all like to stay so busy

                  <p>Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is
                     actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only
                     choice
                     we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type
                     thing
                     to worship-be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some
                     inviolable set of ethical principles-is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.

                  <p>Don't just believe that because something is trendy, that it's good. I'd probably go the other extreme
                     where if something, if I find too many people adopting a certain idea I'd probably think it's wrong or if,
                     you know, if my work had become too popular I'd probably think I'd have to change.

			mathematics, which was already highly developed in Mesopotamia. Perhaps that is why he spent too much money.

		  Life, I knew, was supposed to be more joyful than this, more real, more meaningful, and the world was supposed to be more
		  beautiful. We were not supposed to hate Mondays and live for the weekends and holidays. We were not supposed to have to 
		  raise our hands to be allowed to pee. We were not supposed to be kept indoors on a beautiful day, day after day.
