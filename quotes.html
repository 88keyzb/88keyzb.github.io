          <p>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.
          </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The danger of computers becoming like humans is not as great as the danger of humans becoming like
            computers.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>People are memory palaces, too. They can be revisited like old neighborhoods, after long periods of
            estrangement, calling up memories that were previously forgotten. There is no erasing your past self,
            because
            everything you’ve ever been is sharded and stored among all the people, places, and artifacts you’ve
            interacted
            with.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper.</p>
          <footer>Eden Phillpotts</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the quality of
            life
            depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly successions; and that only
            teachers
            can
            properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of
            classified packages accessible only to those who carry the proper tags.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Adding more lanes to alleviate traffic is liking trying to fix obesity by loosening your belt.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If you want to get an idea of a friend’s temperament, ethics, and personal elegance, you need to look at
            him
            under the tests of severe circumstances, not under the regular rosy glow of daily life.</p>
          <footer>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A child can teach an adult three things: to be happy for no reason, to always be busy with something, and
            to
            know how to demand with all his might that which he desires.</p>
          <footer>Paulo Coelho</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>This monopoly over land turns space into car fodder. It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles.
            Even
            if
            planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting public services, their inhuman velocities would
            degrade
            man's innate mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.</p>
          <footer>Ivan Illich</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Good designers, when they see people having trouble using something they designed, don’t tell the user to
            try
            harder. They fix the design.</p>
          <footer>Aaron Swartz</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Theory: The dreads and dangers of abstract thinking are a big reason why we now all like to stay so busy
            and
            bombarded with stimuli all the time.</p>
          <footer>David Foster Wallace</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>That we end up not even knowing that we don't know is the really insidious part of most math classes.</p>
          <footer>David Foster Wallace</footer>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is
            actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only
            choice
            we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type
            thing
            to worship-be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some
            inviolable set of ethical principles-is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service
            was
            joy.</p>
