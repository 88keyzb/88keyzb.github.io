      <p>It started as a tiny voice in my head, after talking to a friend who finished the Chicago marathon: &quot;You
        really don&#39;t have much going on this year, you got time&quot;. I had bought a spot for the San Francisco
        marathon in 2016, but ended up going to China instead.</p>
      <p>This year, when I bought my spot in January, I didn&#39;t really believe I would do it until I saw the receipt.
        I
        guess this was actually happening.</p>
      <p>My goal was just to finish. I followed Hal Higdon&#39;s Novice 1 training program, about 5 months of training.
        In
        the beginning, 4 or 5 miles looked daunting. 3 months in, a half marathon was the easy long run!</p>
      <p>I loved the routine the training brought to my life. Every Saturday, long run. Only two days off per week. I
        usually ran in the afternoons, but in the summer I had to move to morning runs. I think all this running made my
        overall outlook and attitude of the first half of this year more optimistic. </p>
      <p>Training was very difficult at times. I injured my right ankle on a 5 mile run in Quebec city, making me have
        to
        cut the 20 mile run in half a week later, which was the peak of the training program. </p>
      <p>I had to wake up at 4:45am to run on a two lane road in Arizona and avoid large trucks, while the moon was
        still
        shining (I&#39;m really not a morning person).</p>
      <p>The day of the race snuck up on me. I could hardly sleep the night before in the hotel. </p>
      <p>Surprisingly, the most emotional moment for me was the starting line. All these months of solitary training,
        morning/afternoon runs, and injuries, was worth it, just to make it to the starting line.</p>
      <p>I had so much fun. Within the first mile, I had a double take when I saw a lady next to me running in
        flip-flops.
      </p>
      <p>Made a minor mistake by drinking too much water before the race, I had to use the restroom 4 miles in, but I
        felt
        great after.</p>
      <p>The Golden Gate Bridge was absolutely brutal. It was cold, windy, and foggy, so I couldn&#39;t see a thing most
        of
        the time. The hill on the Marin County side of the bridge was so steep, almost everyone around (including me)
        walked
        it. They didn&#39;t block off the lanes on the bridge this year so it got a little tight on the sidewalk at
        certain
        points.</p>
      <p>Running through Golden Gate park and Haight street as the sun rose was amazing. At this point around 20 miles
        in,
        I
        knew I could finish, and I soaked it all in.</p>
      <p>There is something so freeing about running a race like this without any expectation of time or pacing. I was
        around the 4:35 pacer group for a good chunk of the race, but only because it felt so good to run at that pace.
      </p>
      <p>I stopped at pretty much every water/electrolyte station, and had caffeinated GU gel at mile 13 and 20. </p>
      <p>My knees started to really hurt the last 3 miles, and I ended up walking a couple minutes.</p>
      <p>I always sprint at the end of all my races, this time was no different, but I only had enough in me to sprint
        the
        last .2 miles.</p>
      <p>Before the race, I didn&#39;t really think I would want to do this again. It took up so much of life this year,
        and
        my injury the last couple weeks was super stressful.</p>
      <p>Three days later, I&#39;m ready to sign up for another marathon next year.</p>
