            <p>I still use my iPod Nano, in 2023. 5th generation model, from 2012. The thing still works after almost 12 years. </p>
            <p>It was the first model with a video camera and microphone. I remember a middle school teacher who lamented how easy it was now to record anything discretely. </p>
            <p>I love this thing. I have fond memories of listening to music with it everywhere, from Europe to Santa Cruz to Costa Rica. All the music I&#39;ve ever listened to running has been through it, even for the marathon I ran in 2022. Funny enough, I haven&#39;t touched my running playlist for 7+ years. </p>
            <p>The animated album art scroll was all the rage. I still prefer the click wheel interface to touch screen; it&#39;s much easier to change the song/volume while running.</p>
            <p>I even used to watch &quot;podcasts&quot; on this, but they really were just video shows. I liked one about conspiracies?!</p>
            <p>THEY JUST DON&#39;T MAKE EM LIKE THEY USED TO. </p>
            <p>haha. Thank you iPod for all these years of music. You do one thing really well, which is play music. Recording video, not so much. Here&#39;s to another 14 years.</p>
            <p>P.S. For battery life, I&#39;ve kept it charging all the time when I don&#39;t use it; must have something to do with it lasting so long?!</p>
