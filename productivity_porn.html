	<p>He lives fast. So fast. He needs 27 critical apps to shape his life. He can change your life in a year. Show you how to stop wasting your life, show you why you feel lost, figure out what you really want, unlock your full potential. Make more money, study better, hack your health, and STOP PROCRASTINATING. </p>
<p>How about living without any apps? </p>
<p>People who actually live slow don&#39;t create videos about how slow their life is. No one wants to sponsor someone who lives slow. Slow people don&#39;t buy things needlessly. Slow people don&#39;t pump out new videos, podcasts, and books. </p>
<p>Slow people live with purpose, and their life is not a show for others to watch and consume. </p>
<p>One of the key traits of someone who I don&#39;t trust and give off a bad &quot;smell&quot; is someone whose output is self-referential.</p>
<p>Someone who writes a book about productivity, but how did they make their reputation? By making videos about being productive, and interviewing people on their podcast about productivity, and they write blog posts about being productive, and sell courses on skill share so you can learn to be more productive.</p>
<p>Productivity is a dirty word. I want freedom, and if I&#39;m not free to do absolutely nothing am I really free? </p>
<p>With productivity porn its always about more more more: never less.
More exercise, more content, more money, more sponsorships, more views, more books read, more subscribers, more people &quot;helped&quot;, more happiness.</p>
<p>No room to breathe.</p>
<p>This is why sabbath is so counter cultural; something actually subversive. </p>
<p>This is exactly what Radio Head&#39;s &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is all about:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Fitter, happier, more productive <br>
	Comfortable, not drinking too much <br>
Regular exercise at the gym three times a week
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look, exercise is good. But being more productive and exercising as a way to find all meaning in life is a lie. </p>
<p>I am fine spending a whole day doing nothing. I am fine not buying anything for single day. I am fine skipping a meal. </p>
<p>Living fast is the default. It is not impressive. It takes thought to live slow, because our thoughts are all we have when we take a break from it all. </p>
