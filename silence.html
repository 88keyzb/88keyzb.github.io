      <h1 id="tufte-css">Silence</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Feb 04, 2022</p>
      <p>Most of modern life is not silent. There is talking with others, the noise of freeways and cars, the wind, and
        in
        many public places background music (or muzak).</p>
      <p>I've noticed a trend of thought recently about the importance of solitude and silence. The constant buzz and
        stimulation of life takes away from moments of reflection and peace. There must be a balance. I enjoy these
        moments
        of silence, and try to intentionally build them into my life.</p>
      <p>A wrench has recently been thrown into all of this, which is Covid, but not in the way you'd think. I tested
        positive for Covid, and in the quarantine, I noticed a ringing in my ears that up until that point never seemed
        to
        be significant.</p>
      <p>To my surprise and shock, I am not the only one. There is a possible link between Covid and tinnitus. That
        Covid
        could cause my ears to ring for an extended period of time, even after multiple vaccines and a booster, is not
        something that was on my radar at all.</p>
      <p>During quarantine, I have been attempting to read, but in the silence, the ringing keeps nagging me. But I
        don't
        notice it when I walk outside, or listen to music. From what I've found from sources online, this could be
        temporary
        or permanent. Obviously, I'm very frustrated.</p>
      <p>Whatever comes of this, I think my relationship to silence will be profoundly different. If this is temporary,
        I
        will more than ever appreciate the peace that silence brings. If not, I will have to develop coping mechanisms
        (of
        which currently is to listen to sounds/music while reading) to deal with this. </p>
      <p>Silence is a gift.</p>
